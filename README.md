Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis
 This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster using Python to understand survival
 patterns and build predictive insights.
 Files- Titanic-Dataset.csv - Contains data about Titanic passengers, including age, sex, class, fare, and
 survival status.- task2.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, and building
 survival prediction models.
 Tools & Libraries Used- Python- Pandas- NumPy- Matplotlib- Seaborn- Scikit-learn- Jupyter Notebook
 Project Goals- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)- Clean and preprocess the dataset- Identify patterns and correlations that influenced survival- Visualize key insights- (Optional) Build a basic machine learning model for prediction

 Key Analyses- Distribution of survivors vs non-survivors- Survival rate based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age group
  - Embarkation port- Fare distribution and its impact on survival
 How to Run the Project
 1. Clone the repository or download the files.
 2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
 3. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook task2.ipynb
 4. Run each cell to execute the analysis step by step.
 Insights Discovered- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.- First-class passengers had a better chance of survival.- Younger passengers and children were more likely to survive.- Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival rates
