> This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster using Python to understand survival patterns and build predictive insights.

## 📊 Project Overview

The RMS Titanic disaster of 1912 remains one of history's most studied maritime tragedies. This data science project explores the factors that influenced passenger survival rates, using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in the tragedy.

## 📁 Files Included

- **`Titanic-Dataset.csv`** – Contains comprehensive data about Titanic passengers, including age, sex, class, fare, and survival status
- **`task2.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, and building survival prediction models

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and analysis |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computing |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization |
| **Seaborn** | Statistical data visualization |
| **Scikit-learn** | Machine learning algorithms |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Interactive development environment |

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset structure
- **Clean and preprocess the dataset** to handle missing values and inconsistencies
- **Identify patterns and correlations** that influenced survival rates
- **Visualize key insights** through compelling charts and graphs
- **Build a basic machine learning model** for survival prediction (Optional)

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

### 🔍 Core Analysis Areas

- **Distribution of survivors vs non-survivors** - Overall survival statistics
- **Survival rate analysis based on:**
  - **Gender** - Male vs Female survival patterns
  - **Passenger class** - First, Second, and Third class comparison
  - **Age group** - Children, Adults, and Elderly survival rates
  - **Embarkation port** - Southampton, Cherbourg, and Queenstown analysis
- **Fare distribution and its impact on survival** - Economic factors influence

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repository or download the files**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhisheksingh0505/Titanic-Dataset-task2.git
   cd Titanic-Dataset-task2
   ```

2. **Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Launch the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook task2.ipynb
   ```

4. **Execute the analysis**
   - Run each cell step by step to execute the complete analysis
   - Follow the workflow from data loading to model building
   - Observe visualizations and insights generated

## 💡 Key Insights Discovered

### 🔍 Major Findings

- **👩 Gender Impact**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men
- **🎩 Class Advantage**: First-class passengers had a better chance of survival compared to lower classes
- **👶 Age Factor**: Younger passengers and children were more likely to survive
- **🌍 Embarkation Influence**: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival rates
- **💰 Economic Status**: Higher fare generally correlated with better survival odds

### 📊 Statistical Highlights

The analysis reveals clear patterns in survival based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, providing insights into the maritime disaster's human impact and the "women and children first" evacuation protocol effectiveness.

## 🎨 Visualizations Included

- Bar charts showing survival rates by different categories
- Distribution plots for passenger demographics
- Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships
- Box plots for fare analysis
- Count plots for categorical variables

## 🔬 Data Science Workflow

1. **Data Loading** - Import and examine the dataset structure
2. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Statistical summaries and pattern identification
4. **Data Visualization** - Create meaningful charts and graphs
5. **Feature Engineering** - Prepare data for machine learning
6. **Model Building** - Develop prediction algorithms
7. **Results Interpretation** - Extract actionable insights

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
