Load & Inspect Data
Use df.head(), df.info(), df.describe() to understand structure and types.
Handle Missing Values
Fill numeric columns (e.g., Age, Fare) with median.
Fill categorical columns (e.g., Embarked) with mode.
Visualize Key Features
Histograms & boxplots → Understand distribution, outliers.
Bar plots → Survival vs. Sex, Pclass.
Pairplot/Heatmap → See feature relationships and correlations.
Key Insights
Females, 1st-class, and children had higher survival rates.
Fare has outliers; Age is a strong predictor.
Missing values need careful imputation (not dropping).
Next Step
Use findings for feature engineering and model training.
